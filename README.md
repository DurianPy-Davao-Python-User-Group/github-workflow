```bash

3. Right sidebar scroll down to development
4. Connect your ticket

## Pushing your changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your message here"
git push origin <current branch name>
```

```

## Branch behind? do rebase!
_Do this first before pushing your changes if you are behind!_

```bash
git fetch origin staging
git rebase origin/staging
```
_Stash if you can't rebase_
```bash
git stash
git fetch origin staging
git rebase origin/staging
git stash pop
```
**_Fix possible merge conflicts_**
## Still in staging branch?
_Move to a remote branch_
```bash
git checkout -b DY-<ticket number> origin/staging
```
_If you can't move, stash!_
```bash
git stash
git checkout -b DY-<ticket number> origin/staging
git stash pop
```
## Merge to staging (for reviewers)
1. Do not merge!
2. Press the dropdown beside merge button
3. Click rebase & merge

**_If you have problems with the workflow never hesitate to ask questions_**

**_1 ticket 1 branch rule, make sure to only have 1 branch for each ticket for easier monitoring and reviews_**
